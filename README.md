# Crawling_Web
 Crawling web created with Scrapy 

## Description
Using Scrapy in Python I got 1000 most used words in each language from the site https://1000mostcommonwords.com/ and save it to a Mongo Database.

To this development you only need python and mongodb.
In python you need to install:
* scrapy
* pymongo
